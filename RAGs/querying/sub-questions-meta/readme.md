# SubQuestion Query Engine Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook, `SubQuestion_Query_Engine.ipynb`, showcases the use of a sub question query engine to tackle the problem of answering complex queries using multiple data sources. It demonstrates how to break down a complex query into sub questions for each relevant data source, gather all the intermediate responses, and synthesize a final response.

## Preparation
The notebook guides users through the installation of the necessary libraries, setting up the environment variables, and preparing the data for the query engine.

## Download Data
It includes steps to download the required data for the query engine to function. This involves fetching text data from an external source and loading it into the notebook environment.

## Setup Sub Question Query Engine
The notebook provides a detailed walkthrough on setting up the base query engine as a tool, including the configuration of callback managers and debug handlers to trace the sub questions.

## Usage
Users can follow the instructions in the notebook to set up their own sub question query engine and use it to answer complex queries with the provided data.

## Additional Information
For more details on the implementation and usage of the sub question query engine, users can refer to the tutorial within the notebook.
