# RAGs Project

This project contains a collection of notebooks demonstrating the implementation and usage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. 

## Notebooks

1. [simple_rag.ipynb](RAGs/simple_rag.ipynb): This notebook provides a simple implementation of the RAG model. It's a great starting point for beginners. 

2. [advanced_rag.ipynb](RAGs/advanced_rag.ipynb): This notebook builds upon the concepts covered in the `simple_rag.ipynb` notebook and introduces more advanced techniques for improving the performance of the RAG model.

3. [multi-document_agent.ipynb](RAGs/multi-document_agent.ipynb): This notebook involves working with multiple documents and requires a deeper understanding of the RAG model. It is recommended for experienced users who are familiar with the RAG framework.
